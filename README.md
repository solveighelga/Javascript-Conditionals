# Javascript-Conditionals
## From the random people list I got I made a student list. Each person had more than one value so I used arrays.
## If and else statements:
### JavaScript starts counting from zero. I used the symbol < to compare the dob of two students.
### To see if they have the same amount of children I used the symbol == to compare the numbers.
### To see if they two students knew how to program I used the && symbol to compare the two if it matched going from left to right.
## I used switch statement to see what country the student was from to give appropriate hello response.
## And lastly I used Ternary Operator to see of a number was less than 5.
